<h3>Abstract submission instructions</h3>
Submissions are in the form of extended abstracts (max 2 pages) written in English, in PDF format, formatted according to the **official [LaTex](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15maGbb34Hjq3aWZoXgmW9JVPWj5t1803/view?usp=sharing) or [MS Word](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8gv3h2b7dk7bw6hnep96e/cs2italy_2026_word_template.docx?rlkey=ldbml0427n4oh2p5cx9lpid4t&dl=0) template**. 

The submission should include a title, author names and affiliations, and an extended abstract (serving as the main text of the submission). The abstract should outline the impact of the work, along with (if relevant) the main theoretical contribution, data and methods used, and findings. Authors are strongly encouraged to include figures and/or tables in their submission (note that figures and/or tables, and references will not count towards the page limit). Submitted abstracts will undergo a single-blind review process. Follow the submission link below to submit your abstract.

Submissions will be non-archival, and thus the presented work can be already published, in preparation for publication elsewhere, or ongoing research. Abstracts will be reviewed by multiple members of a Program Committee composed of experts in computational social science. The accepted contributions will be selected for one of the following presentations:  a lightning talk (~6 mins) in a plenary session, or an oral presentation in parallel tracks (~15 mins). Lightning talks will be preferentially assigned to those requesting this form of presentation at submission and to early career researchers. In order to be included in the program, at least one of the authors must register for the conference by the early-bird registration deadline.
